      <h2>Hello! Have you ever wondered how original the music you like is? </h2>
      <!--I think that similar music just makes it easier to find more music I could like!-->
      <p>They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery. One place that it
        is highly controversial and usually unappreciated is in the music industry.
        But is music that sounds similar always stolen/copied/sampled? Could it be a legal
        rewrite like the example below?</p>

      <p>Example #1</p>
      <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5NBPV2NQTepcZy1fD2KI43?utm_source=generator&theme=0"
        title="If You Were a Woman (And I Was a Man) by Bonnie Tyler" width="300" height="80"></iframe>


      <p>Versus</p>
      <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0rmGAIH9LNJewFw7nKzZnc?utm_source=generator&theme=0"
        title="You Give Love a Bad Name by Bon Jovi" width="300" height="80"></iframe>
      <!--Also, Kings and Queens by Ava Max is another rewrite. Fun Fact: Ava Max's music sounds so much
like Lady Gaga's because they are produced by the same studio!-->

      <h2>What about when it really is stealing?</h2>
      <p>There are different kinds of imitations in music</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Direct Copies; uncredited
          <ul>
            <li>Parodies; those are legal</li>
            <li>Copying base lines</li>
            <li>Using direct copies of lyrics</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Samples with permission</li>
        <li>Sample without permission</li>
        <li>Rewrites by the original owner</li>
        <li>Covers! Like Kidz Bop</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Usually the first option results in a lawsuit. For example, Queen & David Bowie vs. Vanilla Ice. In
        1990, he
        released
        "Ice Ice Baby" which a very similar base line to Queen & David Bowie's "Under Pressure." <em>He did
          not credit
          the original writers </em>and this led to a lawsuit.

      <h3>Samples are very common! Even this <em>WORLDWIDE HIT</em> has been sampled!</h3>

        I won't tell you what it is but, here's a hint: Check out the lyrics at 1:02</p>

      <h2>Some Useful Definitions</h2>

      <h2>Parodies</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://dodgelegal.com/general/parody/">Dodge Legal Group's Website</a>
        Dodge Legal Group's Website states: "A parody is actually a written exception to the statutory
        laws that prohibit trademark infringement and some forms of false advertising. While
        a person may own the rights to a song, poem, or another written work, those rights are
        balanced with our Constitutional right to free speech and freedom of expression.
        Usually, the law allows extensive use of the original, well-known work is allowed
        to “conjure up” the original.(Dodge Legal Group)"</p>

      <p>So, a parody is different than someone just copying a song, base line, or lyrics.
        <strong>When used correctly, Parodies are legal.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In a lawsuit called "People for Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney" a parody was
        defined as "A parody must "convey two simultaneous — and contradictory — messages:
        that it is the original, but also that it is not the original and is instead a parody."
        Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publ. Group, Inc., 886 F.2d 490, 494 (2d Cir.1989)
        (emphasis in original). To the extent that an alleged parody conveys only the first message,
        "it is not only a poor parody but also vulnerable under trademark law, since the customer
        will be confused." Id. While a parody necessarily must engender some initial confusion,
        an effective parody will diminish the risk of consumer confusion "by conveying [only] just
        enough of the original design to allow the consumer to appreciate the point of parody.""
